"Twitter Sentiment Analysis using ML" is a project aimed at harnessing machine learning algorithms to analyze the sentiment expressed in tweets. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, the project seeks to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on the emotions and opinions conveyed in their content. Through the use of supervised learning models, such as support vector machines or neural networks, the system will be trained on labeled tweet data to accurately predict the sentiment of unseen tweets. The ultimate goal is to provide insights into public opinion trends and sentiment fluctuations on various topics discussed on Twitter, aiding businesses, researchers, and policymakers in making informed decisions.
